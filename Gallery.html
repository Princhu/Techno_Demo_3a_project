Every day I fight these feelings
For your sake I will hide the real thing
You can run all your life
For mine I will chase...
You should never fight your feelings
When your very bones believe them
You should never fight your feelings
But you have to follow nature's law
I'll live with never knowing
If knowing's gonna change
I'll stop the feeling growing
I will stay away
Like a broken record
Stuck before a song
A million beginnings
None of them the one
Every day I fight these feelings
For your sake I will hide the real thing
You can run all your life
For mine I will chase...
You should never fight your feelings
When your very bones believe them
You should never fight your feelings
But you have to follow nature's law
I wrote her letters and tried to send them
In a bottle I placed my hope
And it's the last will of good intentions
Seek your will, you'll give it to me
Don't make me wait
You build me up, now take me down
But I will stand my ground
And I'm inspired when I'm found
You should never fight your feelings
When your very bones believe them
If you let them show you'll keep them
I know you're hurt but soon you'll rise again
Again, again, again, again, again, again, again
You should never fight your feelings
When your very bones believe them
You should never fight your feelings
I have to follow nature's law
